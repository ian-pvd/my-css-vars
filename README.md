# My CSS Variables

Simple and sane default variables with clearly defined contexts.

Use these variable names consistently across your projects to avoid guesswork. Add or remove variables, and change the values as needed.

Copy & paste this file into your project as a template and customize it. Or, import all these values as defaults and override them in your theme.
